TITLE GABAA receptor


COMMENT
GABAA receptor conductance using a dual-exponential profile
presynaptic short-term plasticity based on Fuhrmann et al, 2002
Implemented by Beatriz Herrera April 8 based on the implementation by
Srikanth Ramaswamy, Blue Brain Project, March 2009 and Guy 2018.
Some modificaations of Ramaswamy implementation were made based on
MÃ¤ki-Marttunen et al., J of Neurosci Methods. 293, 264-283 (2018).
GUY: Removed  plasticity and depression

        Use = 1.0   (1)   : Utilization of synaptic efficacy (just initial values! Use, Dep and Fac are overwritten by BlueBuilder assigned values)

        e = -80     (mV)  : GABAA reversal potential
    	:gmax = .001 (uS) :1nS weight conversion factor (from nS to uS)
    	u0 = 0 :initial value of u, which is the running value of Use
}

COMMENT
The Verbatim block is needed to generate random nos. from a uniform distribution between 0 and 1
for comparison with Pr to decide whether to activate the synapse or not
