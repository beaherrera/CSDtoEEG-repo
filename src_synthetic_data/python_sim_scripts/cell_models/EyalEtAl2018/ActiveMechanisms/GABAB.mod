TITLE GABAB receptor


COMMENT
GABAB receptor conductance using a dual-exponential profile
presynaptic short-term plasticity based on Fuhrmann et al, 2002
Implemented by Beatriz Herrera April 8 based on the implementation by
Srikanth Ramaswamy, Blue Brain Project, March 2009 and Guy 2018.
Some modificaations of Ramaswamy implementation were made based on Yang et al.
2016 Nat Commun. 7, 1â€“14 (2016).
GUY: Removed  plasticity and depression

        tau_d_GABAB = 80     (ms) : IMPORTANT: tau_r < tau_d
        Use = 1.0   (1)   : Utilization of synaptic efficacy (just initial values! Use, Dep and Fac are overwritten by BlueBuilder assigned values)

        e = 0     (mV)  : GABAB and NMDA reversal potential
    	:gmax = .001 (uS) :1nS weight conversion factor (from nS to uS)

}

COMMENT
The Verbatim block is needed to generate random nos. from a uniform distribution between 0 and 1
for comparison with Pr to decide whether to activate the synapse or not
