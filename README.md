# N2pcBiophysicalModeling
Resolving the mesoscopic missing link: Biophysical modeling of EEG from  cortical columns in primates.

Main analysis code for figures in Herrera and Westerberg et al. 2022.

## Dependencies
- MATLAB (released 2021b, [The MathWorks](https://www.mathworks.com/?s_tid=gn_logo)). Toolboxes: Signal Processing Toolbox.
- NEURON simulator (http://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron)
- LFPy 2.2 (https://github.com/LFPy/LFPy)
- [CSDplotter-master](https://github.com/espenhgn/CSDplotter)
- [Brainstorm](https://neuroimage.usc.edu/brainstorm/Introduction)
- Elephant (https://elephant.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- Neo (https://neo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

## Description
- [sim_L5PCsPop](sim_L5PCsPop): Biophysical simulations performed for Figure 2. 
- [sim_V4data](sim_V4data): Lead fields and dipoles' location used in Herrera and Westerberg et al. (2022) to estimate the contribution of V4, LIP, 7A and FEF to the N2pc. Dipoles' location and lead fields were calculated for both the NMTv2 atlas and monkey Y head models.
  * [compDipEEGfromCSD.m](compDipEEGfromCSD.m): code to calculate the EEG generated by two dipoles (one in each hemisphere) estimated from the laminar current source density (CSD) â€“ a derivative of LFP. This function will output the current dipole moments estimated from the CSD and the EEG evoked by their combine activation.
